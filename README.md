# Antenna-Tracker-for-FRsky-Telemetry
Frsky Sport Telemetry Decoder and Antenna Tracker  
The FRskyR9MDecoder library and SportDecoderTracker sketch run on an Arduino Uno and decode the Frsky Telemetry which is available on the Taranis or Frsky R9M module Sport pin. The library and sketches will translate the GPS latitude, longitude and altitude data into a bearing from the tracker to the quad and an angular altitude to the quad. These in turn are translated into angular movements of horizontal and vertical servos to track the quad across the sky.
